# How to install all the benchmarks on Ubuntu16.04 without compiling manully? 
  This part is about installing all the benchmarks from binary. If you would like to build it by hand, please look at HERE.
  
  For Supertuxkart, you can download from the website: https://supertuxkart.net/Download
  You should download the linux version and untar the file and run the script to start the game.

## How to build SuperTuxKart?

Reference: https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/blob/master/INSTALL.md

1. Download source file and install dependence packages
  $ git clone https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code stk-code
  $ svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/supertuxkart/code/stk-assets stk-assets
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libbluetooth-dev \
                       libcurl4-openssl-dev libenet-dev libfreetype6-dev libfribidi-dev \
                       libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libjpeg-dev libogg-dev libopenal-dev libpng-dev \
                       libssl-dev libvorbis-dev libxrandr-dev libx11-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev

2. To compile SuperTuxKart, run the following commands inside stk-code directory:
  $ mkdir cmake_build
  $ cd cmake_build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make -j4
   
Further Options:
  To create a debug version of STK, run:
  $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   
You can install your build system-wide:
  $ sudo make install
   
The default install location is /usr/local, i.e. the data files will be written to /usr/local/share/games/supertuxkart, 
the executable will be copied to /usr/local/bin. To change the default installation location, 
specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when running cmake, e.g.: cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/stk

Trouble Shooting:
if you build supertuxkart in different position, you may can not find the path to data. You need to set the SUPERTUXKART_DATA envirionment viriable to the "data" in source code directory.
