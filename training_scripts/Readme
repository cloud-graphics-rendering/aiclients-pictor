The repository saves scripts for training games.
    
    Directory Description:

    lableImg/ saves QT tool for labeling dataset, and the dataset will be in xml format.
    object_detection/ saves scripts from tensorflow projects and we make some modification to suit our new project.

    Scripts Descritption:

    lstm* 
        These fils are used to train LSTM network. Our AI makes decision via LSTM.
    mobileNet* 
        These files are used to train mobileNet to do object detection.

You can use either python2 or python3 to run the following scripts:

AI-play-SuperTuxKart.py
AI-play-0ad.py
AI-play-redeclipse.py

How to set up enviroment at server side and client side?
For server side:
1. launch a VNC session: 5901
   /opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -3dwm -measure

For client side(VNC setups):
1. connect to VNC session 5901
   /opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer ip:5901
   
2. press F8, set the resolution to be 1280x960. Uncheck "Full-screen mode" and uncheck "Show toolbar by default".
   Save changes, close VNC window and reconnect to the 5901 session. Allign the VNC window to left up cornner of the desktop.

3. Open a terminal in VNC and align it to left up corner of the VNC window. Enter into the directory where you saves commands to
   start each graphic intensive applications.
   $ cd xxx/graphic-intensive-apps/

For client side(local python setups):
How to set up the python envirionment before you run the scripts? On a new ubuntu16.04 machine, you need the following 4 steps.
1. Open a terminal on your local machine, and you need switching to root mode:

    $ sudo -i
    
2. Go to the scripts directory:

    ~# cd xxx/bench-train-games
    
3. Install python modules with pip:
    
    ~# pip install tensorflow opencv-python mss keyboard pyuserinput matplotlib

ATTENTION: 
Before running each application by scripts, you should confirm that you can run each program in GRBench successfully
and maximize the GUI.

How to run AUTOMATICLLY?
    
    ~# python AI-paly-xxx.py
   
   If you still lack python modules, just install them with pip command.
